Android Cloud Photos
====================

#### IN BETA VERSION

## What this is

This is An Android application to sync photos to a variety of online cloud services.

It's built to handle multiple providers, but I'm probably only going to use Rackspace Cloud Files with it.

## What's working?

Everything so far!

You can use US and UK Rackspace accounts.

You can log in

You can see your container list

You can create a container

Authentication Tokens are cached

## What needs doing?

UI! Please help out. I'm absolutely pants at making things look good.


## What's broken?

I don't think anything is actually broken, but there is an edge case...

If you delete your container, the application will not recognise this. It'll keep reauthenticating with the service. This is a minor bug, but still, it is a bug.

### Honorable Mentions
